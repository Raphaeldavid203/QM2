Hi, I've noticed that the week 9 problem set doesn't open completely on GitHub, 
there's a big section that doesn't load, even though it's saved on colab. 
Just in case, here are my answers in text format:

Part A: What is the effect of the minimum wage increase on unemployment in the case of Kansas and Ohio?
The introduction of a minimum wage in Ohio led to a 1.5734 % increase in unemplovment relative to Kansas

Part B: Difference in Differences designs have two assumptions: parallel trends, and no simultaneous treatment.
Can you think of any events that ocurred in 2008 that might violate the "no simultaneous treatment" assumption?
We can think of two major events: the global financial crisis: this could have influenced employment and wage levels,
independently of any changes to the minimum wage; and the 2008 Economic Recovery Act: this scheme, 
which included tax rebates for individuals and tax incentives for businesses, may have had an impact on employment rates.
